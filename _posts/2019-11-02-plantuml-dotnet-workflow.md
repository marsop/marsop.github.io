We are entering 2020 and it is yet not quite easy to (automatically) generate diagrams based on your code. 
Sure, there are a myriad of options, But when it comes to integration, pricing or simply ease of use, they all more or less fall apart. 
Maybe I am getting ahead of myself here, letÂ´s define first what I mean by UML-Workflow. 

When starting a new project, the requirements are layed out and somehow, somebody will pave the way for the developer team. 
The preferred way to do this for the teams where I have worked so far is to prepare some kind of documentation. 
Most often than not, this would be some kind of UML documentation.

Now this documentation will be obsolete almost from the get-go, since as anybody that has worked in a real-world project knows, requirements change.
In order to keep the diagrams up-to-date, you can force your developers to update the diagrams everytime a change is approved.
IMHO this is not more than some harmless wishful thinking. Not once have I seen a team disciplined enough to take this idea and run with it.
Even in some scenarios, where the teams are rather motivate
