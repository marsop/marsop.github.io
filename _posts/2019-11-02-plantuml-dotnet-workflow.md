title: "My PlantUML Diagram-Based Workflow for .NET"

We are entering 2020 and it is yet not quite easy to (automatically) generate diagrams based on your code. 
Sure, there are a myriad of options, but when it comes to integration, pricing or ease of use, they all start to show their shortcomings. 
Maybe I am getting ahead of myself here, letÂ´s start by defining first what I mean by Diagram-Based Workflow (DBW). 

When starting a new project, the requirements are layed out and somehow, somebody will pave the way for the developer team to start producing functionality. 
The preferred way to do this for the teams where I have worked with so far is to prepare some kind of documentation.
Most often than not, this documentation would be some kind of washed down UML documentation.
It is not really that UML documentation beats any other kind, but it allows to represent the key elements of the architecture, communication between components and event key actors in a visually appealing way.

Now this documentation will be obsolete almost from the get-go, since as anybody that has worked in a real-world project knows, requirements change.
In order to keep the diagrams up-to-date, you can force your developers to update the diagrams everytime a change is approved.
IMHO this is not more than some harmless wishful thinking. Not once have I seen a team disciplined enough to take this idea and run with it.
Even in some scenarios, where the teams are rather motivate
