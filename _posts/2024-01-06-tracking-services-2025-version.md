Almost 4 years have passed since my last entry with respect to tracking services (which you can read [here]({% post_url 2021-03-20-tracking-services)) and I feel that somehow it is time to revise the topic once again and compare how things worked post-pandemic (there are indeed some changes, but mostly everything has keep working as it used to)

Without further ado, here is my current list of trackers:

## Books 📚

- [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/)
- Status: 👍 Healthy

Goodreads remains the most comprehensive online database for book tracking, featuring a "nice enough" user-friendly interface. The platform's emphasis on the "yearly challenge" introduces a gamification element to reading, which tends to somehow make me prioritize quantity over quality. Oh well.. for tracking, Goodreads continues to be the leading service in this area.

## Music 🎵

- [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/)
- Status: 👍 Healthy

Prior to this review, I had to verify that Last.fm is still integrated with Spotify, my primary music streaming service. This speaks to the seamless integration that these two have achieved as of 2025. The application has been consistently "scrobbling" and recording my listening habits since 2009. Given its reliability, there is no compelling reason to switch to an alternative service.

## Movies 📽

- [FilmAffinity](https://www.filmaffinity.com/) + [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/)
- Status: 👍 Healthy (kinda)

FilmAffinity's lack of integration, together with the other problems mentioned last time (notably the horrendous interface and the focus on subscription services) have not been solved in these last four years. In fact, the web design looks directly out of 2000, thankfully its contents are a little bit more modern. Sad state of affairs for sure.

On the other side of the spectrum, Trakt.tv is a modern tracker (at least for me originally just for series) that has been steadily gaining traction due to the simple integration with software like Kodi and Plex.

I am still using both for the time being, but I expect to drop FilmaAffinity at some point in the near future. Maybe once Trakt.tv has access to something else than Hollywood Blockbusters..

## Videogames 🕹

- [GOG Galaxy 2.0](https://www.gog.com/galaxy) (previously `How long to Beat`)
- Status: 👍 Healthy

Previously I used `How Long To Beat` (or HLTB for short) to track and obtain a little bit of information about the different games. Nowadays, HLTB is decently integrated in XBOX Game Pass and its main statistic (Average Time To Beat) is visible in the interface without having to visit the painfully designed website. On the other hand, since there is still no good recommendation system for my taste, I use `Metacritic` to scratch that itch.

GOG Galaxy meanwhile is an unassuming software, which clearly tries to nudge its users towards its own shop (it is in the name guys) while providing an easy-enough to navigate database.

## TV Shows 📺

- [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/)
- Status: 👌 Perfect

What I say then: I am happy with trakt.tv, it integrates seamlessly with my workflow and the statistics are good enough for my purposes. Trakt.tv in fact also tracks movies, and it is a contender in that space as well. Unfortunately they do not yet include as many movies as I would like.

What I say now: ditto.

## Screen Time 💻

- [Trisco]()
- Status: 👍 Healthy

My employer uses a very questionable software to track time (whose name I would not name here). The functionality for the end-used is so bad that I had to do something about it. And so I did. Enter TRISCO. This is a tool that I use to keep track of my time (for the moment only during working hours). The synchronization is then done in the background without any further user interaction required. It is far from perfect, but also a level higher than the previous solution available to me, so I am happy for the time being.

## MOOC (online courses) 🎓

- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)
- Status: 👍 Healthy

I do not believe that Pluralsight offers unique content that cannot be found elsewhere. However, it is easy to search, convenient, and it does have an extensive library. I have not conducted thorough research in this category because this platform is provided by my employer, making it my primary resource for all course-related activities. In general, only once I have confirmed that the platform does not include anything of interest, I search the web for alternatives, often finding obscure pages that offer "too-good-to-be-true" and "once-in-a-lifetime" kind of deals.. like twice a day.
