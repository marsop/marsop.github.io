Have you ever wondered what is the unit that "comes after" an hour? Say you are measuring length. You can measure kilometers if you are measuring things like plots of land, or, say, meters if you are measuring a person. It is even possible that you are measuring something smaller using millimeters. One core aspect of all those units is that you can transform one into another. Indeed, you can do this with most units we are used to (some truly crazy people use other units to measure these kinds of things, but also those are convertible). Now say that you are measuring time.
