I like to keep track of things. Call it what you will, but for me, being able to analyse my own habits helps me keep an illusion of control over them. There are several categories that I am currently tracking. For each of them over the years I have tried different options and finally settled with (better or worse) services to keep my data. Nowadays I try to choose services that would allow me to take my data away should I find a better alternative.

I know this puts off a lot of people because of privacy concerns. Honestly, this is not something that worries me too much at the moment, but is definitely something to look out for. Keep the finger on the pulse about what other options could be out there.

Without further ado, here is my current list of trackers:

## Books

- [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/)
- Status: üëç Healthy

This one comes from a far away time. Much before Amazon bought the platform, I tried several services before settling for Goodreads like [Librofilia](https://www.librofilia.com/). More recently I have been looking into [readng](https://beta.readng.co/). They just did not offer all I needed at the time. Nowadays, Goodreads is the clear juggernaut in this space (book-habit-tracking). There are several things that I do not like, but the interface is clear enough, it has a huge database and phone apps to boot. One thing is the seamless integration in Kindle where it synchronizes notes and highlights (only for books bought on Amazon). Sadly, the kindle integration only works with a kindle configured with the US-Marketplace.

## Music

- [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/)
- Status: üëç Healthy

This one also comes for a long time ago, back in the days of Winamp if I recall it properly. My listening habits are also. Mostly receiving data from Spotify nowadays, which anyway works better as my source for recommendations.

## Movies

- [FilmAffinity](https://www.filmaffinity.com/)
- Status: üëé Searching for replacement

This web is not good. The fact that in the latest years they are specialising in acting like a billboard for the subscription services of the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime does not help. The recommendations are still somehow acceptable. The database is missing some less know productions.

## Videogames

- [How long to Beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/)
- Status: üëé Searching for replacement

This one has a horrible interface (seriously guys, this is so 1990s) and the mobile app does not really allow you to track anything, just check the database. One of the big missing points is a good recommendation engine. Deciding what to play next is never an easy task, and HLTB does not really help in this regard. On the other hand, the ability to track time is very interesting when compared to the community.

## TV Shows

- [Trakt.tv.](https://trakt.tv/)
- Status: üëå Perfect

I am happy with trakt.tv, it integrates good with my work flow and the statistics are good enough for me.

## Screen Time

- Contestants
  - [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/)
  - [Procrastitracker](http://strlen.com/procrastitracker/)
  - [Toggl](https://toggl.com/)
- Status: üß™ Currently testing

This one is currently undergoing renovation. The idea here is automatically track in what i spend the time while in the computer (s). Each of the following has at least one problem:

- Waka Time: it integrates with IDEA IntelliJ, Visual studio and Visual studio Code. That's it, it is mostly thought for coding, which is only a small part of what I want to track.
- ProcrastiTracker : available through Chocolatey, it seems quite good, but keeps only a local DB (which means I cannot use it between machines or outside Windows..)
- Toggl: Mostly manual tracking, not quite what you want...

## MOOC (online courses)

- Nothing here yet.
- Status: üîç searching
