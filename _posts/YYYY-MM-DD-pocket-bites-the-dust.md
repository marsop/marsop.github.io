The web has evolved a lot since the times in which reading full length blog posts was THE WAY to consume content. Moving to much more inmediate (and short) kind of content has been the norm for a while. The average content of a TikTok vido is apparently 35s. 

I may be old fashioned, but somehow, collecting curated articles and read them offline in my kindle or reMarkable is still much more appealing than mindlessly consuming a stream of content preselected by an algorithm. Curation is the key word here. It is not hard to find an algorithm to preselect text articles (medium is a good example of a business based on this). Now, to curate them involves to skeem through the content (manually or with the help of automation), select the best options, and finally save it for later while tagging it. 

I have been using a service called Instapaper since 2014. At the beginning, the functionality was quite adapted to my needs. I would go to my RSS feeds and preselect content to store in Instapaper and read later in my trusty Kindle Paperwhite. This service is unfortunately remarkably useless for content with other types of media (other than text, that is). Image parsing was always a hit-or-miss with some articles including all the messages in the articles, others including just the first one and some including none at all. However, where this broke most often than not was in parsing of math formulas and code. Unfortunately, the kind of articles that include those are the most common targets for such a read-it-later service, and thus Instapaper showed a limited usability. 

In order to be able to read those (and even some fancy javascript visualizations that started appearing with the advent of Jupyter Notebooks), I started triaging blog posts into "just text with (maybe) a bunch of images" and "everything else". For this second category, I would use a new fancy platform called Pocket. The benefit being that that one worked exceptionally well with tablets, which gave me the option to catch up with this kind of content when at home and access to the tablet (an iPad 3 long gone through the path of planned obsolescence rigorously marked by Apple).

Well, earlier this year, Pocket has closed doors. Before that it was bought by Mozilla, which apparently did not planned to keep the light on for the long run. Be as it may, I found myself in a position where read-it-later articles was again in the hands of a couple of paid incomplete applications. 

It took me about 30' to find a suitable alternative in the form of a self-hosted Wallabag instance. By using Oracle Cloud for hosting, I have now my very own Wallabag server, which I can access from all my daily devices and I can consume without the stupid limitations imposed by Instapaper both in my tablet as well as koreader (which is currently my default reading application in my e-reader). A win-win, since the saves are under my control, and I do not have to worry a new decommission of a service.
