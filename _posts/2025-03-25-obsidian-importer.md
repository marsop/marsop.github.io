This time I admit I am late to the party. I have been using Notion for years and loving it more a more as I learn how to properly configure it for my use cases. Lately, I have introduced it as a documentation tool and low-code application platform for all kinds of organizational tasks. I may write about some of those in the future. For the moment however, I am leaving it at a private level. Not leaving it completely, mind you. As I explained in [[2025-03-05-johnny-decimal]], my document organization is following this pattern and one of the main places where I do have information is Notion. The problem is that while I am mostly ok with the lock-in of the platform for current applications (for example the planning of an upcoming trip), I find it troublesome when it comes to my private knowledge base (aka second brain).

Notion is an application that can boast many different features, but speed is not one of them. With their online all-in approach, the app takes a while to start, run and search stuff. This is something that the offline all-in approach from Obsidian handles much more gracefully.
